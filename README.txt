You'll see two versions in this project: a 2 segment arm, and a 3 segment arm. 

After building and testing the 3 segment arm I wasn't satisfied with its accuracy and control--this is due to
backlash in the shoulder joint gear and the quality of the servos I'm using. If I had used metal gears and higher
torque servos the control would have been noticeably better, but gearing this joint will inherently have some
play to it--something I would revise in another project.

The 2 segment arm takes a lot of pressure off the shoulder joint and gives me much better control. This is noticeable in
some of the videos, and you can begin to see the (interpolated) inverse kinematics as the claw moves in a relatively straight line.

I'd like to revisit this project with better materials and with a little more experience, but overall I think I got
some good demonstrations.
